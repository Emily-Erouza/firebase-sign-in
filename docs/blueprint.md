## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#778899) for a clean and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8FF), very slightly desaturated hue of the primary.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), analogous to slate blue, to add a touch of gentleness.
- Font Pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body. 'Poppins' gives a modern feel while 'PT Sans' provides great readability for the form elements and instructions.
- Use simple and professional icons for form fields, such as an envelope for email and a key for password.
- Keep the form layout clean and uncluttered with clear spacing and alignment. Use a single column layout for both forms for ease of use.
- Subtle transitions and animations on form elements when they are focused or validated, providing feedback to the user.
